# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! I'm **Arden**, a chemistry graduate transitioning into the exciting world of computer science. My journey combines the analytical rigor of chemistry with the innovative potential of smart systems, robotics, and Industry 4.0 technologies.

### 🤯About me

🎓 **Academic Background**: With a solid foundation in electrochemistry and materials science, I've gained a strong understanding of problem-solving and experimental methodologies.

💻 **Tech Journey**: I started learning programming with C language and quickly became fascinated by embedded systems, intelligent robotics, and IoT. Now, I'm diving into computer science to build cutting-edge solutions for the future.

### 🛠️ Core Skills:

**Programming:** C, Python, basic Java, and database.

**Soft skills:** Experienced in leveraging AI tools to boost productivity and solve complex problems.

### 🌟 Featured Project: MTtranslator

MTtranslator is a lightweight, custom-built machine translation tool designed for real-time translation using advanced NLP models.

#### 🔍 Why I Built It

As a non-native English speaker, I search for a free, real-time translation application to help me better understand English-speaking courses. While many tools are available, most are subscription-based. Inspired by Windows' Live Captions for speech-to-text, I envisioned creating a simple tool to translate captions in real-time. MTtranslator reflects my commitment to practical and accessible intelligent system solutions.

#### 🦑 Key Features

- **Optimized Performance**: Designed for systems with limited hardware (e.g., AMD 8845H with 32GB RAM) by leveraging lightweight NLP models for fast and reliable translations.
  
- **Offline Capability**: Functions without an internet connection, ensuring privacy and convenience.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a clean and intuitive UI for effortless use.
  

### 🚀 My Current Goals

- Enhance MTtranslator by adding support for more languages and features like contextual translation.
- Expand my knowledge in machine learning and embedded systems.
- Develop more projects that integrate smart systems and Industry 4.0 technologies.

### 🌱 My Journey So Far

Each project, from creating a student grade management system to developing **MTtranslator**, has been a valuable learning experience. These endeavors have honed my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and passion for innovation.
