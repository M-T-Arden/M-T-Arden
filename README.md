# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! I'm Arden, a chemistry graduate transitioning into the exciting world of computer science. My journey combines the analytical rigor of chemistry with the innovative potential of smart systems, robotics, and Industry 4.0 technologies.

###  🤯About me

🎓 Academic Background: With a solid foundation in electrochemistry and materials science, I've gained a strong understanding of problem-solving and experimental methodologies.
💻 Tech Journey: I started learning programming with C language and quickly became fascinated by embedded systems, intelligent robotics, and IoT. Now, I'm diving into computer science to build cutting-edge solutions for the future.

### 🛠️ Core Skills:

**Programming:** C, Python, basic Java, and database.

**Soft skills:** Skilled in AI tools

### 🌟 Featured Project: MTtranslator

MTtranslator is a lightweight, custom-built machine translation tool designed for real-time translation using advanced NLP models.

###### 🔍 Why I Built It

I wanted a free real-time translation application in case I'm not used to the courses in English. But the most of these tools are charged. Windows has a free tool called Live Captions that does great work in real-time speech-to-text. So I wonder if I can develop a simple tool to translate the captions. MTtranslator reflects my focus on practical applications of intelligent systems.

###### 🦑 Key Features

- Optimized for systems with limited hardware (My machine is an AMD 8845H with 32GB of RAM.), using small NLP models to ensure fast and reliable translations.
  
- Using offline with simple and intuitive user interface.
  

### 🚀 My Current Goals

Enhance MTtranslator with more languages and advanced features like contextual translations.
Deepen my knowledge in machine learning and embedded systems.
Build more projects that integrate smart systems and Industry 4.0 applications.

### 🌱 My Journey So Far

Every project, from managing student grade systems to building MTtranslator, has taught me practical problem-solving and highlighted my ability to adapt and innovate.
